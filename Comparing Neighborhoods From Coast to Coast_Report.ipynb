    "Cities are large human settlements. Each city has its own characteristics and they are usually complex and not easy to measure. Also, within each city, different neighborhoods provide similar or different access to resources, entertainments, facilities, etc.. Studying the subtle differences or similarities among neighborhoods can provide valuable insights for both individuals and businesses. The following are some examples of how this type of studies can help us solve problems that looks complicated at first glance.   \n",
    "\n",
    "__Help in individual relocation decisions__  \n",
    "When a person decides to move to another city or a different part of the city but want to keep certain life style, it would be good to know whether the place he's going is similar to where he lives. For instance, if he is a fan of Chinese food, and the place he's moving to also has many Chinese restaurants, then it might be a good choice for his tastes. However, we are usually looking at more than one factor when we consider living environment and our preferences are not always lexicographic. Does the new place also have a park within walking distance? Is there a bank nearby? Is the subway station close enough? And if none of the candidates look perfect, are some better than the rest? Such problems can be solved using machine learning and find neighborhoods that are relatively similar.   \n",
    "\n",
    "__Solve business problems__  \n",
    "Aside from personal interests, these analyses can ease or solve some of the business problems as well. Small businesses, such as restaurants or coffee shops, can benefit when they want to start their first shop or find a new location to expand. Instead of going through rigorous assessment of opening a new shop, which is usually costly for small businesses without a lot of data and resources, the location distribution of existing venues could help in the initial screening. Take pizza shop as an example, a good place to start a new shop could be somewhere that people go for food but does not have a lot of other pizza shops. So in an initial screening, an efficient way would be picking out similar neighborhoods that have many food providers, which suggests high meal demand in the area. Then further filter out neighborhoods with relatively less direct competition, in this case, other pizza shops. Of course, if the pizza shop is worried that other types of food services are too hard to beat, they can use the same method to locate neighborhoods without enough food suppliers.   \n",
    "\n",
    "__Scope of the work__  \n",
    "In this project, I use machine learning method to compare neighborhoods in three famous US cities, New York, Chicago, and Seattle. New York locates on the east coast of US. It is the largest city of the country in terms of population and considered as one of the economic centers of the world. According to 2018 Census Bureau estimates, New York has 8.4 million residents living in five boroughs. Chicago is the most populous city in the Midwest. Located on the west shore of Lake Michigan, the city has a population of 2.7 million. Seattle is a seaport city on the west coast of the US. As a fast growing city, Seattle has 0.75 million residents and home to many fast growing firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tons of aspects to look at when comparing these cities. To simplify things, I only focus on access to venues. K-means clustering is employed to group similar neighborhoods across cities. I then explore the most popular venues in each group in the attempt to capture the uniqueness of the group. While I used a general approach in this practice project, the methods can be further refined to answer specific questions, such as finding candidate locations for a new pizza shop."

    "In order to gather the necessary data to conduct the analysis described in the previous section, I need information of popular venues in each neighborhood. To achieve the desired data structure, I divide the data gathering process into three steps and I pull data from three different sources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Gathering the data__  \n",
    "The first part of the data set is the names of each neighborhood in the cities of interest. I use Wilipedia as the source and gather list of neighborhood names from corresponding web pages listed below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "New York, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City;  \n",
    "Chicago, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Chicago;  \n",
    "Seattle, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Seattle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tables containing neighborhood names are scraped into data frames using Python libraries. The second part of the data is the geographic location of these neighborhoods. I use the Geocoding application programming interface (API) service provided by Google to gather the latitude and longitude of the presumed center of each neighborhood using their names, cities, and states. In the final step, I use Foursquare.com's API to gather venue information of each neighborhood. Popular venues within 500 meter radius of the neighborhood center are gathered. Number of venues can vary a lot in neighborhoods, some neighborhoods may only have a handful of venues returned from Foursquare.com, some may have have hundreds. I limit the maximum number of venues gathered in each neighborhood to 100. Name, category, and geographic location of each venue are stored in the data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Data description__  \n",
    "There are a total of 127 neighborhoods in Seattle, 246 neighborhoods in Chicago, and 327 neighborhoods in New York. Foursquare.com's API fails to return any venue information for ten of the neighborhoods. As a result, these neighborhoods are dropped from the data set. A total of 690 neighborhoods enter the clustering and a total of 496 unique venue categories are recorded among these neighborhoods."

   "source": [
    "This project is conducted in Jupyter notebook using Python 3. In order to cluster neighborhoods with similar access to certain venue categories, I use k-means clustering method to group neighborhoods. Scikit-learn library for Python is used in creating clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "__How does the algorithm work?__  \n",
    "A preset number of centers are selected and assigned random initial values. In each iteration, the distance of each data point to each center are calculated. Each data is assigned to the closest center. All data points with the same center are labeled within the same cluster. Then the mean of each cluster becomes the new center in the next iteration. This process continues until the result converges.    \n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/wangyw80/Test-Projects/blob/master/formula.png?raw=true\" width=\"160\" >  \n",
    "In the formula above, variance in cluster m is calculated as the sum of the variance of all n members. For each member, the variance is the sum square of the difference between attribute j of the observation and the attribute j of center m. The goal is to find a set of centers that minimize the within-cluster variance. However, the locations of the initial centers matter. This approach does not always guarantee a global solution. Therefore, in practice, we need to use different starting points to check if the result converges to a global solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Calculating the distance__  \n",
    "Given the form of the data, all venue categories are name strings. Therefore, I need to perform transformation on the data before the k-means clustering method can be applied. All venue categories are turned into dummy variables and equals one if a venue of that category exist. The total number of venues in each category are then summed for each neighborhood and normalized to get the weight of each category. For example, if five venues are found in a neighborhood, three are coffee shops, one restaurant, and one book store, then the corresponding values would be 3 for coffee shop, 1 for restaurant, and 1 for book store. The weight would be 60% for coffee shop, 20% for restaurant, and 20% for book store. The metrics of the weight of the venue categories are used in computing the distance to the cluster centers. To simplify the calculation, I only use the weight of the top 15 venue categories of each neighborhood in clustering.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Finding the proper number of clusters (k)__  \n",
    "In k-means clustering, one of the key parameter is number of centers. Given the nature of this study, it is hard to tell how many clusters I should set. Unlike analysis that can have limited categories of outcomes, the definition of \"similar neighborhoods\" is vague and cannot be quantified objectively. Therefore, I compare the share of each cluster in each city with different number of starting centers (3 to 8). The goal is to have enough clusters that can break down relatively similar neighborhoods into clusters but not creating too many clusters with only outliers and subgroups that are not meaningful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the shortfalls of the k-means algorithm is that the starting location matters and a global solution is not guaranteed. So for each number of groups, I run my codes multiple times to find the most common outcomes.    \n",

Type IV are seen in both Chicago and Seattle, but rare in New York. We now know which neighborhoods are similar but we still want to know similar how.

    "As shown in table two, the dominant venue types in a typical downtown neighborhood are food services. In type VI neighborhoods, seven of the top ten venue types are food providers, along with bar, gym, and park. This is not surprising for a downtown area, as so many people have to work and social there, which creates demand for these services. Type I, which is the dominant type in New York outside of Manhattan, is also populated with food providers. However, in type I neighborhoods, the dominant food providers are fast food, there are also pharmacies, factories and banks. Just by looking at these venue categories, one can already conclude that it's going to be less costly living in type I neighborhoods than living in type VI ones. Type III neighborhoods, which is only common in Chicago, has a mix of Mexican food, fast food, fabric shop, grocery stores, etc.. Type IV, uncommon to New York, but fairly popular in other two cities, concentrates on park, eye doctor, exhibits, and even farm. These dominant venue types in each group provide us with further context of how a typical neighborhood in each group would look like. We could also have a better idea of what to expect in an unfamiliar neighborhood.  \n",
